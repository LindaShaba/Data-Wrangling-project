Import one dataset onto one sheet and the other onto another one.

Have a good look at each dataset to understand what information you have and what it might tell you.Use filters to interrogate the data. Think about maybe using Pivot charts and pivot tables.
The drinks file has some problems with its data (e.g., missing values, numeric columns stored as chars, etc.) and need to be cleaned before further use. 
a) List the data-related issues you see in this data set. 
b) How will you address each data-related issue? Give justification for why you chose a particular way to address each issue. 

Research the average amount of pure alcohol contained in beer, wine, and spirits and compute the total_litres_of_pure_alcohol column values in the drinks table. Document the source of the final numbers you use for this step.
Decide on an appropriate column to join the Life Expectancy data with your drinks data.
Using VLOOKUP bring the ‘total litres of pure alcohol’ data from the drinks table to the life_expectancy table.
